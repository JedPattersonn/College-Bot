I toured your campus and it just feels like the perfect fit for me. I'm sure you get a lot of these requests, but I was wondering if there is any chance I could receive a pennant, flag, shirt or really anything you guys are able to offer me! I would love to start representing my school pride as early as possible. If you guys are able to help me out, my address is {address} I am looking forward to being a student and getting my collegiate career started!"
